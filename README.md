# 🚀 Machine Learning Projects by Trevin Rodrigo🤖

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!  
Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on projects where I explore real-world problems using popular ML techniques. The notebooks cover data preprocessing, training models, evaluating performance, and sometimes even deployment.

## 📁 Project Highlights

### 🏥 `hospital-readmission-predictor`  
Predicts whether a patient is at risk of being readmitted to the hospital using key clinical and demographic inputs.  
✔️ Flask web app powered by a trained Random Forest model with real-time predictions and user-friendly UI.


### 📊 `cost_estimator`
An ML model that estimates the cost of living based on inputs like housing, food, healthcare, etc.  
✔️ Includes model training, predictions, and deployment-ready Flask app.


### 🏠 `Predicting house prices using regression`
Predicts house prices using regression techniques.  
Good example of feature selection and model tuning.

### 📈 `stock-market-predictor`
Predicts stock market trends using machine learning techniques.  
Focus on regression models and time series analysis.

### 💼 `income_predictor`
Predicts if a person’s income is above or below a certain threshold using demographic and financial features.  
Includes label encoding, model evaluation, and export using `joblib`.

### 🔍 `EDA on a dataset using K-NN`
Performs Exploratory Data Analysis and applies the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to a classification problem.

### 🔐 `Fraud Detection Using Support Vector Machines`
Uses SVM to detect fraudulent activities in a financial dataset.

### 📚 `fcc_book_recommendation_knn`
A book recommendation system using collaborative filtering with KNN.

### 📱 `fcc_sms_text_classification`
Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

### 🌳 `Machine learning - Decision Trees`
Demonstrates how decision trees work with examples and visualizations.
