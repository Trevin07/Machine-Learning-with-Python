# 🚀 Machine Learning using Python🐍

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Repository**, where I explore various ML techniques, algorithms, and real-world applications. This repository contains projects covering **supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment**.  

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- 🔹 **Regression & Classification** (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)  
- 🔹 **Neural Networks & Deep Learning** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNNs, NLP)  
- 🔹 **Unsupervised Learning** (K-Means, PCA, Clustering)  
- 🔹 **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**  
- 🔹 **Model Optimization & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
- 🔹 **End-to-End ML Pipelines & Deployment**
